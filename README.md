# colorizeEggs-mduernberger

Projectdescription: In this game 12 Easter eggs are generated. The eggs roll down one by one and land in a basket. Your task is to color the eggs, which are white at the beginning. Turn them into the right color (red, green, blue) by clicking on the corresponding (on/off) switch. You can also turn off all colors at once. 
In the upper left corner you can see the number of orders needed and the ones already done.

If all eggs are colored correctly, you have won. If not, you have lost. After that you can refresh and start from the beginning.
